[TRPC](https://trpc.io): This package is used as our IPC layer.Having using this package in my projects has made interprocess communication much easier , especially with the ease of [Electron TRPC](https://www.electron-trpc.dev/).I had originally used [Interprocess](https://github.com/daltonmenezes/interprocess) by Dalton Menezes , which was great, But the lack of typesaftey became a problem once my project grew significantly but luckily I found electron-trpc after some research and it's been great to me

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team) : Typescript interface for our storing data in a local database , Ideal for offline first applications and other applications that will need to store some other type of information locally that is too structured or too large for web local storage.Offline first apps have become more and more popular in Userland , and building apps with offline first in mind , is a key strategy to success for indie app developers , So drizzle and SQLite are great fits for projects targetting those environments

[Legend State](https://legendapp.com/open-source/state) : New state management library for React and javascript , focused on providing the fine grained reactivity promised by other frameworks without hacking React internals , I've used this in personal and professional projects recently after it's announcment and for a new package it shows a lot of promise , This along with [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) are my state managers of choice , I've added Legend state to this starter template because of its' relative easy of use and familiarity to people from other state managers like MobX , XState , Valtio and others like it but also to inspire me to use it a bit more in my own personal projects.

[React](https://react.dev) : The Default frontend framework shipped with the Starter.My personal framework of choice , I use SolidJS as well , but the UI Framework ecosystem around it leave much to be desired so I decided to leave it out for now

[ElectronVite](https://electron-vite.org) : A new way to build electron applications , previously , I've worked with webpack based starter packs , and they work great , until they don't and they become more pain than they're worth , especially when trying to work with wasm binaries and even pnpm , so I set out looking and found electron-vite , a great package and a great starter kit , but their starter seemed a bit too much for me , mostly because on scaffolding a new project , you're greeted with many folders and even a **.d.ts** file , which seemed a bit overkill for some of the things I was trying to do , so I stuck to using just the package and building my own starter around it , and here it is.This project did start as a Webpack based project but I have a feeling electron-vite I the only way you and I should go

[Electron Builder](https://electron.build.) : Tool for packaging electron apps for distribution , there isn't much to say about this package , it's pretty ubiquitous in the electron community

[Better-Sqlite3](https://github.com/wiselibs/better-sqlite3): The best way to interact with an sqlite database in nodejs and thus electron

[Biome JS](https://biomejs.dev) : For formatting and linting.
